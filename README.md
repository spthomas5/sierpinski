sierpinski: a visualization powered by recursion

This simple program was written in Java, using a generic StdDraw library to draw shapes to the screen. It uses recursion in order to draw Sierpinski triangles of 
a desired order. 

This program was my first time practicing recursion. By seeing the ease in which it illustrated Sierpinski triangles of various orders, it made me understand the 
power of the concept.
